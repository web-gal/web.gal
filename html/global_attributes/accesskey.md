The `**accesskey**` [global attribute](/html/global_attributes) provides a hint for generating a keyboard shortcut for the current element. The attribute value must consist of a single printable character (which includes accented and other characters that can be generated by the keyboard).

**Note**: In the WHATWG spec, it says you can specify multiple space-separated characters, and the browser will use the first one it supports. However, this does not work in most browsers. IE/Edge uses the first one it supports without problems, provided there are no conflicts with other commands.

The way to activate the accesskey depends on the browser and its platform:

|  | Windows | Linux | Mac |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Firefox | Alt + Shift + _key_ | On Firefox 57 or newer: Control + Option + _key_ or Control + Alt + _key_  
On Firefox 14 or newer: Control + Alt + _key_  
On Firefox 13 or older: Control + _key_ |
| Internet Explorer | Alt + _key_  
Alt + Shift + _key_ | N/A |
| Edge | N/A | Control + Option + _key_  
Control + Option + Shift + _key_ |
| Google Chrome | Alt + Shift + _key_ |
| Safari | N/A |
| Opera 15+ | Alt + _key_ | Control + Alt + _key_ |
| Opera 12 | Shift + Esc opens a contents list which are accessible by accesskey, then, can choose an item by pressing _key_ |

## Accessibility concerns

In addition to poor browser support, there are numerous concerns with the `accesskey` attribute:

-   An `accesskey` value can conflict with a system or browser keyboard shortcut, or assistive technology functionality. What may work for one combination of operating system, assistive technology, and browser may not work with other combinations.
-   Certain `accesskey` values may not be present on certain keyboards, especially when internationalization is a concern. So adapting to specific languages could cause further problems.
-   `accesskey` values that rely on numbers may be confusing to individuals experiencing cognitive concerns, where the number doesn't have a logical association with the functionality it triggers. 
-   Informing the user that `accesskey`s are present, so that they are aware of the functionality. If the system lacks a method of notifying the user about this feature, the user might accidentally activate `accesskey`s.

Because of these issues, it is generally advised not to use `accesskey`s for most general-purpose websites and web apps.
