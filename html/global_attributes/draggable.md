The **draggable** [global attribute](/html/global_attributes) is an enumerated attribute that indicates whether the element can be dragged, either with native browser behavior or the [HTML Drag and Drop API](/api/html_drag_and_drop_api).

`draggable` can have the following values:

-   `true`: the element can be dragged.
-   `false`: the element cannot be dragged.

This attribute is _enumerated_ and not _Boolean_. A value of `true` or `false` is mandatory, and shorthand like `<img draggable>` is forbidden. The correct usage is `<img draggable="false">`.

If this attribute is not set, its default value is `auto`, which means drag behavior is the default browser behavior: only text selections, images, and links can be dragged. For otherÂ elements, the event {{ domxref('GlobalEventHandlers.ondragstart', 'ondragstart') }} must be set for drag and drop to work, as shown in this [comprehensive example](/api/html_drag_and_drop_api/drag_operations).
