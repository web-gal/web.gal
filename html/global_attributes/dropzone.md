The **`dropzone`** [global attribute](/html/global_attributes) is an enumerated attribute indicating what types of content can be dropped on an element, using the [HTML Drag and Drop API](/api/html_drag_and_drop_api). It can have the following values:

-   `copy`, which indicates that dropping will create a copy of the element that was dragged.
-   `move`, which indicates that the element that was dragged will be moved to this new location.
-   `link`, which will create a link to the dragged data.
