## Usage notes

The `<header>` element is not sectioning content and therefore does not introduce a new section in the [outline](/en-US/docs/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document). That said, a `<header>` element is intended to usually contain the surrounding section's heading (an `h1`â€“`h6` element), but this is **not** required.

### Historical Usage

Although the `<header>` element didn't make its way into specifications until [HTML5](/glossary/html5/), it actually existed at the very beginning of HTML. As seen in [the very first website](http://info.cern.ch/), it was originally used as the `<head>` element. At some point, it was decided to use a different name. This allowed `<header>` to be free to fill a different role later on.

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/html/global_attributes).
