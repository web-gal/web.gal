## Attributes

## Usage notes

-   Do not use the `<aside>` element to tag parenthesized text, as this kind of text is considered part of the main flow.

## Examples

### Using <aside>

This example uses `<aside>` to mark up a paragraph in an article. The paragraph is only indirectly related to the main article content:

```html
<article>
  <p>
    The Disney movie <cite>The Little Mermaid</cite> was
    first released to theatres in 1989.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      The movie earned $87 million during its initial release.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    More info about the movie...

```
