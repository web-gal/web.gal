{{ HTMLRef }}

The HTML `<input type="datetime">` was a control for entering a date and time (hour, minute, second, and fraction of a second) as well as a timezone. **This feature has been [removed from WHATWG HTML](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/336)**, and is no longer supported in browsers.

Instead, browsers are implementing (and developers are encouraged to use) `[<input type="datetime-local">](/html/element/input/datetime-local)`.

The format of the date and time value used by this input type is described in {{ SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats", "Format of a valid global date and time string") }}.
