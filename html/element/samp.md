The **HTML Sample Element** (**`<samp>`**) is used to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program. Its contents are typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font (such as [`Courier (typeface`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface) or Lucida Console).

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/html/global_attributes).

## Usage notes

You can use a CSS rule to override the browser's default font face for the `<samp>` element; however, it's possible that the browser's preferences may take precedence over any CSS you specify.

The CSS to override the default font face would look like this:

```css
samp {
  font-family: "Courier";
}
```

If you need an element which will serve as a container for output generated by your website or app's JavaScript code, you should instead use the [`output`](/html/element/output/) element.

## Examples

### Basic example

In this simple example, a paragraph includes an example of the output of a program.

```html
<p>When the process is complete, the utility will output the text
<samp>Scan complete. Found <em>N</em> results.</samp> You can then
proceed to the next step.</p>
```

The resulting output looks like this:

{{ EmbedLiveSample("Basic_example", 650, 100) }}

### Sample output including user input

You can nest the [`kbd`](/html/element/kbd/) element within a `<samp>` block to present an example that includes text entered by the user. For example, consider this text presenting a transcript of a Linux (or macOS) console session:

#### HTML

```html
<pre>
<samp><span class="prompt">mike@interwebz:~$</span> <kbd>md5 -s "Hello world"</kbd>
MD5 ("Hello world") = 3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62

<span class="prompt">mike@interwebz:~$</span> <span class="cursor">â–ˆ</span></samp></pre>
```

Note the use of [`span`](/html/element/span/) to allow customization of the appearance of specific portions of the sample text such as the shell prompts and the cursor. Note also the use of `<kbd>` to represent the command the user entered at the prompt in the sample text.

#### CSS

The CSS that achieves the appearance we want is:

```css
.prompt {
  color: #b00;
}

samp > kbd {
  font-weight: bold;
}

.cursor {
  color: #00b;
}
```

This simply gives the prompt and cursor fairly subtle colorization and emboldens the keyboard input within the sample text.

#### Result

The resulting output is this:

{{ EmbedLiveSample("Sample_output_including_user_input", 650, 120) }}
