The **`noopener`** keyword for the `[rel](/html/attributes/rel)` attribute of the [`a`](/html/element/a/), [`area`](/html/element/area/), and [`form`](/html/element/form/) elements instructs the browser to navigate to the target resource without granting the new browsing context access to the document that opened it â€” by not setting the {{ DOMxRef("Window.opener") }} property on the opened window (it returns `null`).

This is especially useful when opening untrusted links, in order to ensure they cannot tamper with the originating document via the {{ DOMxRef("Window.opener") }} property (see [About rel=noopener](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/) for more details), while still providing the `Referer` HTTP header (unless `noreferrer` is used as well).

Note that when `noopener` is used, nonempty target names other than `_top`, `_self`, and `_parent` are all treated like `_blank` in terms of deciding whether to open a new window/tab.
