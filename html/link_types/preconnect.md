The **`preconnect`** keyword for the {{ HTMLAttrxRef("rel", "link") }} attribute of the [`link`](/html/element/link/) element is a hint to browsers that the user is likely to need resources from the target resource's origin, and therefore the browser can likely improve the user experience by preemptively initiating a connection to that origin.
